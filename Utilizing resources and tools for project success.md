# Project Initiation — Resources, Documentation, and Tools
## Instructor-Level Summary with Visual Models

---

## 1. Resource Management in Project Initiation — *What Makes Work Possible*

> 🧩 **Project resources are everything you depend on to get work done.**

Project resources include:
- **Budget** (money)
- **People** (skills and time)
- **Materials** (physical or digital)

> 🧠 **Instructor Insight:**  
> Resources are interconnected.  
> No budget → no materials.  
> No materials → people can’t work.

```

Early resource planning prevents:

- Understaffing

- Budget overruns

- Last-minute surprises

## 2. Budgeting for Projects — Planning the Money

💰 A project budget estimates the total cost required to complete the project.

Common Budget Categories

Team costs: salaries, hours, contractors

Services: vendors, consultants

Materials: tools, software, equipment

📌 Instructor Rule:
If you overspend in one category, you affect all others.

Why Budgeting Starts in Initiation

Reveals hidden costs

Aligns scope with reality

Sets stakeholder expectations early

## 3. People — Your Most Critical Resource

👥 Projects succeed or fail based on people.

What PMs Must Confirm

Skill alignment with tasks

Time commitment and availability

Buy-in and motivation

🧠 Instructor Insight:
The best partners are people aligned with the project’s goals — not just assigned to it.

## 4. Materials — Physical and Digital

🧱 Materials are anything required to complete the work.

Examples:

Physical: equipment, supplies

Digital: software licenses, cloud storage

Intangible: training, documentation

📌 Instructor Rule:
If it costs money or time, include it in your materials plan.

## 5. Documentation — How Projects Remember Decisions

📝 Documentation captures what was decided and why.

Why Documentation Matters

Communicates goals, scope, and resources

Preserves early decisions

Helps onboard new team members

Reduces rework and confusion

```

## 6. Types of Documentation
Formal Documentation

Emails

Presentations

Digital documents

Shared folders or tools

Value of Documentation

Reveals missing tasks or costs

Serves as a historical record

Supports future projects

🧠 Instructor Insight:
If it isn’t documented, it didn’t happen.

## 7. Project Proposal vs. Project Charter
```mermaid
graph LR
    Proposal[Project Proposal] --> Charter[Project Charter]
```

Project Proposal

Created first

Persuades stakeholders

Explains why the project should exist

Project Charter

Created after approval

Defines what the project is

Used throughout the lifecycle

📌 Key Difference:
Proposal = ask for permission
Charter = permission granted

## 8. Project Charter — The Project Compass

🧭 The project charter guides every major decision.

Why the Charter Matters

Aligns strategy, scope, and value

Grants authority to the PM

Serves as a single source of truth

🧠 Instructor Insight:
A strong charter prevents weak execution.

## 9. Key Components of a Project Charter
```mermaid

  root((Project Charter))
    Summary
    Goals
    Business_Case
    Scope
    Deliverables
    Success_Criteria
    Budget
    Schedule
    Risks
    Team
    OKRs
    Approvals
```
Typical Charter Elements

Project name & summary

SMART goals

Business case (benefits vs. costs)

Scope (in & out)

Budget and timeline

Risks and assumptions

Stakeholders and approvals

📌 Instructor Rule:
Include enough detail to guide — not overwhelm.

## 10. Tools in Project Management — Making Work Visible

🛠️ Tools help you plan, track, and communicate.

Why Tools Matter

Increase transparency

Improve coordination

Track progress and resources

Reduce manual effort

```

## 11. Choosing the Right Tool

🎯 The best tool fits the project — not the other way around.

Selection Considerations

Project size and complexity

Team familiarity

Stakeholder needs

🧠 Instructor Insight:
Simple tools often outperform complex tools on small projects.

## 12. Introducing New Tools Successfully
Best Practices

Communicate early

Ask for stakeholder feedback

Run demos or trials

Ensure accessibility

Provide training

Plan transition periods

📌 Pro Tip:
Adoption fails more often than tools do.

## 13. Common Project Management Tools
### Work Management Platforms

Asana

Trello

Monday.com

Basecamp

ClickUp

Jira

Spreadsheets

Google Sheets

Excel

🧠 Instructor Insight:
Learn one tool deeply — others will feel familiar.

## 14. Using Spreadsheets Effectively
### Core Capabilities

- Collaboration (edit, comment, view)

- Lists and structured data

- Sorting and filtering

- Conditional formatting

- Charts and graphs

- Calculations and formulas

```mermaid

```

## 15. Templates — Work Smarter, Not Harder

Common templates:

- Project timelines

- Budget trackers

- Gantt charts

- Event marketing plans

📌 Instructor Rule:
Templates save time and reduce errors.

## 16. Why Projects Fail — Resource & Initiation Issues

    Failure --> Docs[Poor Documentation]
    Failure --> Tools[Wrong Tools]

```
### Preventable Causes

- Unclear expectations

- Unrealistic budgets or timelines

- Miscommunication

- Resource shortages

- Scope creep

🧠 Instructor Insight:
Most failures are preventable — and start in initiation.
