# Agile & Scrum Fundamentals – Definitions with Clear Examples

This document explains key Agile & Scrum concepts using **simple definitions** and **practical examples** to make learning easier.

---

## 1. Product Backlog

### Definition
The Product Backlog is an **ordered list of everything needed** to improve or build a product.  
It is **dynamic** and changes as the product and market evolve.

### Key Points
- Owned by the **Product Owner**
- Prioritized by **business value**
- Continuously refined

### Example
For a **library website**, backlog items may include:
- View book reviews
- Search books by category
- User login system

---

## 2. User Stories

### Definition
User stories describe **what the user wants** and **why**, from the user's perspective.

### Standard Format
```
As a <user role>, I want <action> so that <benefit>.
```

### Example
As a library member, I want to read book reviews so that I can choose better books.

---

## 3. I.N.V.E.S.T. Criteria

Used to check whether a user story is well written.

| Letter | Meaning | Explanation |
|------|--------|------------|
| I | Independent | Can be built without relying on other stories |
| N | Negotiable | Details can be discussed |
| V | Valuable | Delivers value to the user |
| E | Estimable | Team can estimate effort |
| S | Small | Fits into one Sprint |
| T | Testable | Has clear acceptance criteria |

### Example
A story like *“Improve website”* is **bad** (not testable or estimable).  
A story like *“Add search bar to homepage”* is **good**.

---

## 4. Epics

### Definition
An Epic is a **large user story** that cannot be completed in one Sprint.

### Example
Epic: *Library Website Development*  
User stories inside the epic:
- View book reviews
- Borrow books online
- Manage user accounts

---

## 5. Backlog Refinement

### Definition
Backlog Refinement is the process of **reviewing, clarifying, estimating, and prioritizing** backlog items.

### Example
The team discusses:
- Is the story clear?
- Should it be split?
- Is the estimate reasonable?

---

## 6. Estimation Techniques

### Purpose
To estimate **relative effort**, not exact time.

### Common Techniques
- Planning Poker
- Dot Voting
- Bucket System
- Affinity Mapping

### Example
Story A feels twice as hard as Story B → Story A gets more points.

---

## 7. T-Shirt Sizes & Story Points

### Definition
Relative estimation using sizes or numbers instead of hours.

### Mapping Table

| Size | Time (Days) | Story Points |
|----|------------|--------------|
| XXS | 0.01–0.5 | 1 |
| XS | 0.5–1 | 2 |
| S | 1–2 | 3 |
| M | 3–5 | 5 |
| L | 6–8 | 8 |
| XL | 9–10 | 13 |
| XXL | 11–14 | 21 |

### Example
Adding a button → **S (3 points)**  
Building payment system → **XL (13 points)**

---

## 8. Sprint

### Definition
A Sprint is a **fixed-length iteration** (1–4 weeks) where the team delivers usable work.

### Key Rules
- Sprint Goal does not change
- Quality does not decrease
- Backlog can be refined

### Example
Sprint Goal: *Enable users to read book reviews*

---

## 9. Sprint Events

| Event | Purpose |
|-----|--------|
| Sprint Planning | Decide what to build |
| Daily Scrum | Sync daily progress |
| Sprint Review | Show completed work |
| Sprint Retrospective | Improve the process |

---

## 10. Increment vs MVP

### Product Increment
- Potentially releasable work at the end of a Sprint
- Fully tested and usable

### MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
- Smallest product version to learn from users

### Example
Increment: Book review feature  
MVP: Reviews for fiction books only

---

## 11. Velocity & Burndown

### Velocity
Average story points completed per Sprint.

### Burndown Chart
Shows remaining work over time.

### Important Notes
- Velocity is **not** a performance metric
- Do not compare velocity between teams

---

## 12. Boards & Tools

### Purpose
Visualize work and improve transparency.

### Common Tools
- Jira
- Asana
- Trello
- ClickUp

### Board Columns
- To Do
- In Progress
- Done

---

## Final Tip
Scrum is about **learning, adapting, and delivering value**, not following rules blindly.
