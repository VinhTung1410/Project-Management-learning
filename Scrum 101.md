# Scrum Foundations
## Pillars, Values, and Roles

---

## 1. The Three Pillars of Scrum

> 🏛️ **Scrum is built on empiricism** — decisions are based on what is observed, not assumptions.

### Transparency
Transparency means making all important aspects of work visible to everyone involved.

- Progress, blockers, and decisions are visible
- Shared understanding among team members and stakeholders
- Builds trust and reduces costly misunderstandings

> 🧠 Transparency answers: *“What is really happening?”*

### Inspection
Inspection involves regularly examining progress toward Sprint goals.

- Happens frequently (Daily Scrum, Sprint Review)
- Detects undesirable variances early
- Enables learning and course correction

> 🧠 Inspection answers: *“Are we on track?”*

### Adaptation
Adaptation is adjusting behavior, plans, or processes when issues are discovered.

- Encourages embracing change
- Prevents repeating mistakes
- Improves future outcomes

> 🧠 Adaptation answers: *“What should we change?”*

📌 Exam Tip:

## 2. Scrum Values — How Teams Behave
🧭 Scrum values guide behavior so the pillars can function effectively.

### Commitment

## 3. Integrating Pillars and Values

Adaptation requires respect and commitment

📌 Exam Shortcut:
Pillars = what Scrum does
Values = how Scrum teams behave

## 4. The Scrum Master — Servant Leader
